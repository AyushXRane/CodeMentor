# CodeMentor üéì

A conversational AI teaching assistant designed for AP Computer Science students learning Python (CSP) and Java (CSA).

## Features

- **Subject-Specific Guidance**: Switch between Python (AP CSP) and Java (AP CSA) modes
- **Educational Philosophy**: Guides learning without providing direct solutions
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Modern, responsive design with syntax highlighting
- **Topic Organization**: Quick access to common CS concepts
- **Debugging Support**: Step-by-step debugging guidance
- **Code Structure Help**: Teaches proper coding patterns and best practices

## Teaching Approach

CodeMentor follows educational best practices by:

- ‚ùå **Never providing complete solutions** or finished code
- ‚úÖ **Explaining concepts** with clear examples and analogies
- ‚úÖ **Giving hints and guidance** to help students think through problems
- ‚úÖ **Providing pseudocode** and partial code snippets with blanks to fill
- ‚úÖ **Teaching debugging strategies** and problem-solving approaches
- ‚úÖ **Encouraging step-by-step reasoning**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server setup required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start learning!

### Usage
1. **Select Subject**: Choose between Python (CSP) or Java (CSA) using the header buttons
2. **Ask Questions**: Type your questions in the chat input
3. **Browse Topics**: Click on topics in the sidebar for quick explanations
4. **Use Hint Chips**: Click on suggested prompts to get started

## Example Interactions

### ‚ùå What NOT to ask:
- "Give me the full code for this assignment"
- "Write the complete program for me"
- "What's the exact answer to question 5?"

### ‚úÖ What TO ask:
- "Can you explain how loops work?"
- "I'm getting an error in my code, how do I debug it?"
- "What's the difference between arrays and ArrayLists?"
- "How do I approach this problem step by step?"

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **Code Highlighting**: Prism.js for syntax highlighting
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Educational Philosophy

CodeMentor is designed around the principle that **learning happens through guided discovery**, not by receiving answers. The AI assistant:

1. **Asks guiding questions** to help students think through problems
2. **Provides conceptual explanations** rather than code solutions
3. **Teaches debugging strategies** instead of fixing code directly
4. **Encourages experimentation** and learning from mistakes
5. **Builds problem-solving skills** that transfer to new situations

## Contributing

This is an educational tool designed for AP Computer Science students. If you'd like to contribute:

1. Ensure all responses maintain the educational philosophy
2. Test with both Python and Java scenarios
3. Keep the interface simple and focused on learning
